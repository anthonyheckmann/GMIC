" class="img_block" style="margin: 3px; border: 0px solid #808080; float: left;" height="200" width="200" />Selective blur aims to preserve edges while reducing noise. Both phenomena exhibit very high rates of change, but noise tends to random, mutually cancelling impulses while edges exhibit a degree of coherency. This command tends to agressively blur noise in locales where the average rate of change is relatively low, impulses notwithstanding as these tend to cancel out, while avoiding regions where pixels clump into distinct populations of color or luminosity that give rise to edge locales of rapid average color and luminosity change.</p>
<p>The command has the following format:</p>
<p>-blur_selective: sigma&gt;=0,_edges&gt;0,_nb_scales&gt;0</p>
<ul>
<li><em>sigma:</em> sets the standard variation, or spread of a gaussian kernel for blurring in regions of locally constant color and luminosity. a non-negative number. One must supply a value, there are no defaults. The actual blurring in a particular locale will be less, or even zero, in the proximity of edges. See _nb_scales, below.</li>
<li><em>_edges:</em> sets edge sensitivity. Higher numbers (greater than unity) tends toward preserving edges, but also noise. Lower numbers (0.01 - 0.4) permits more aggressive blurring, but can cause edges to disappear. The optimal value depends on particularities of images; 0.5 is a good starting point. The parameter is optional and defaults to 0.5.</li>
<li><em>_nb_scales:</em> sets the number of steps in degree of blurring from the maximum established by sigma, above, and zero (no blurring whatsoever). The actual standard variation applied to a particular locale depends on the average rate of change of color or luminosity in that locale, tending to zero as the local rate of change in color or luminosity increases. Higher values divide the range between zero and sigma into a greater number of smaller steps. Larger numbers tend to eliminate mach banding, but the command runs longer. This parameter is optional and defaults to 5 steps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Selective Gaussian Scaling</h2>

<p>Internally, blur_selective employs -<a target="_parent" href="http://gmic.sourceforge.net/reference.shtml#gradient_norm">gradient_norm</a> as an edge detector; after processing with <a target="_parent" href="http://gmic.sourceforge.net/reference.shtml#quantize">-quantize</a>, this image becomes a map</p>
