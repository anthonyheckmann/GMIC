<h2>Conjuring Images out of the Aether and Other Generators.</h2>
<p>Typically, images arrive at the pipeline by way of the '-input' command or as an output of some transformative command. To this, one may also conjure an image out of the aether. The process is fairly straightforward. Where an '-input' command might be invoked, one instead writes a series of four integer parameters, spatial dimensions, separated by commas, with no embedded white space. The four numbers represent the width, height, depth and spectral dimensions of an image, like so:</p>
<p><code>$ gmic 1036,850,1,3 ...</code></p>
<p>which will produce an image 1036 pixels wide, 850 pixels high, one pixel deep, with a spectral dimension of three channels; it will be black unless one writes an optional fifth parameter, a mathematical script that defines image content procedurally, a topic that we will defer to some later page. This will conjure an image out of the aether, ready to be transformed by some follow-on command, typically a generator like '-plasma' or '-noise'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all dimensions need to be furnished; omitted dimensions default to one. So</p>
<p><code>$ gmic 100</code></p>
<p>produces a 100x1x1x1 image. The special form</p>
<p><code>$ gmic 0</code></p>
<p>produces an empty image where all dimensions are zero. If output, the resulting file will have zero bytes. This special case primarily serves scripts that may be generating images dynamically; the zero dimensioned image serves as a boundary case that can trigger a loop exit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Images may also be conjured up from other images by way of <a target="_parent" class="internal" href="command-decorations.shtml#isoselect" title="Isolated Selections: Implied Copy Command">selections</a>, image indices appearing within square braces. This is an implied copy command; it places the copied images at the end of the pipeline.</p>
